    - Contacts - The HTML5 specification mentions that the Contacts API allows to have a common contacts repository in the browser which can be access by any web application.
    - Selection - The selection API supports selecting items in DOM (supports CSS3 type of selectors), to be used along with JQUERY.
    - Offline apps - This API allows marking pages to be available in Offline mode. This is useful if a resource requires dynamic processing.
    - Indexed database - This API is meant for a database of records holding simple values (including hierarchical objects). Every record has a key and a value. An indexed database is supposed to be implemented using b-trees. Web SQL DB is no longer being pursued as part of HTML5 specification.
    - Web workers - This API is meant to be invoked by web application to spawn background workers to execute scripts which run in parallel to UI page. The concept of web works is similar to worker threads which get spawned for tasks which need to invoked separate from the UI thread.

    - Canvas 2D Context - This API provides objects, methods and properties to draw and manipulate graphics on a canvas drawing surface.
    - HTML Microdata - This API is used to annotate content with specific machine-readable labels, e.g. to allow generic scripts to provide services that are customized to a page. Microdata allows nested groups of name-value pairs to be added to documents.
    - Media Capture - This API is used to facilitate user access to a device's media capture mechanism (camera, microphone, file upload control, etc.). This only coves a subset of media capture functionality of the web platform.
    - Web Messaging - This API is used for communications between browsing contexts in HTML documents.
